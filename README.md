# MADS-MMS Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio project of MADS-MMS module at FH Kiel in the first semester. By making use of the clustering algorithms, I covered the insights behind the sustainable buildings' database from the ÖKOBAUDAT Database (https://www.oekobaudat.de).  

For this portfolio project, I employed k-means clustering and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to analyze the environmental impact data from the datasets of LCA found in the EPDs, which are collected annually from the ÖKOBAUDAT. This analysis aimed to identify patterns and clusters that could inform our company and clients about the environmental performance of our products.  

For this, I used Python and Jupyter Notebook with various libraries that are used widely for data science, which are: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Yellowbrick, Matplotlib, Seaborn. For the preparation of data, I performed data cleaning with pandas and prepared the final DataFrame to perform visual data interpretations, which gave meaningful insights for the market and the industry.
